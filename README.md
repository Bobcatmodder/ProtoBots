# ProtoBots project

https://theprotobotproject.wordpress.com

Welcome! The goal of this project to create a simple, easy to use, accessible robot platform for education, home, research, and other purposes. Here you can find design files, code, and more for building your own Protobot, modifying, or whatever your heart desires

The file ProtoBotsV02.Zip is an arduino library containing example code.

NOTE: This is a work in progress, so things are not all together yet. As of this edit, there is enough information here to build a Protobot.
