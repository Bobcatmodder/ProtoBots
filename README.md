# ProtoBots project

Welcome! The goal of this project is to create a simple, easy to use, acsessable robot for education, home, reasearch, and other purposes. Here you can find design files, code, and more for building your own Protobot, modifying, or whatever your heart desires.

The file ProtoBotsV02.Zip is an arduino library containing example code.

NOTE: This is a work in progress, so things are not all together yet. As of this edit, there is enough information here to build a Protobot.
