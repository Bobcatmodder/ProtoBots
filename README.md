# The ProtoBot project

https://theprotobotproject.wordpress.com

Welcome! The goal of this project to create a robot platform that's

Simple and easy to use

    With a total of 2 motors, and 4 sensors, the ProtoBot is a very simple robot.
    Don’t let it fool you, though! You can still do a lot with it, especially with programming. 
    It’s also very easy to build. In our experience, a middleschooler can build one in several
    hours, including soldering the board.

Low Cost and Accessible

    Using cheap, common components, the ProtoBot is easily sourced online. The plastic parts 
    can be printed on any 3D printer that has a  build volume over 10x10x5, or ordered from a
    3D printing service online. The PCB can be either hand etched, or obtained through a 
    PCB prototyping service.

100% Open Source

    Everything is open source, even the guides. That means anyone can:

      Download all design files, source code, and documentation free of charge
      Modify all or any part of the work
      Distribute the original, or modified versions of the work
      Sell copies of the original, or modified work


NOTE: Still a work in progress- If anything's missing, please contact me!
