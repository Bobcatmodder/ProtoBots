# The ProtoBot project

https://theprotobotproject.wordpress.com

Welcome! The goal of this project to create a simple, easy to use, accessible robot platform for education, home, research, and other purposes. Here you can find design files, code, and more for building your own Protobot, modifying, or whatever your heart desires


NOTE: Still a work in progress, but as we continue to develop code, guides, and new versions of things, they'll be added here.
