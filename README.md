# ProtoBots project

Welcome! The goal of this project is to create a simple, easy to use, acsessable robot for education, home, reasearch, and other purposes. Here you can find design files, code, and more for building your own Protobot, modifying, or whatever your heart desires.

NOTE: This is a work in progress, and as of this edit, the protobots are still in development stages.
