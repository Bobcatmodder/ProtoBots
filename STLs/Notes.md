STL files. 
These can be printed at 0.2 MM resolution, and require no rafts or supports.

Usually I print the base at 103% scale, and the antenna parts at 105%, to ensure everything fits. It depends on how precise your printer is. I also usually scale the PCB supports to be twice as tall, cause they're not really tall enough as is.

The "4Antenna" file is just 4 antenna pieces in one STL, so that you can fit more on a printbed.
